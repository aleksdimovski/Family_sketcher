# FamilySketcher --- Program Sketcher based on Lifted Analysis 

This tool is a research prototype program sketcher designed for resolving numerical sketches using lifted static analyzis based on abstract interpretation

# Installation

The tool requires the following applications and libraries:

* OCaml 

	```
	(sudo) apt-get install ocaml-interp
	```

* Findlib

	```
	(sudo) apt-get install ocaml-findlib
	```

* Menhir: LR(1) parser generator

	```
	(sudo) apt-get install menhir
	```
  
* Opam: https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html

	```
	(sudo) apt-get install opam
	```
  
* OUnit

	```
	opam install ounit
	```

* APRON: numerical abstract domain library

	```
	opam install apron
	```
* Set the Library Path variable in ~/.bashrc open with "gedit ~/.bashrc" 

	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/aleks/.opam/system/share/apron/lib
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH


* Zarith: arbitrary-precision integer operations

	```
	opam install zarith
	```


# Compiling lifted_analyzer

Once all required libraries are installed, 'ocamlbuild' can be used to build lifted_analyzer with the following command:

```
eval $(opam config env)                 % It will setup environment variables, that are necessary for the toolchain to work properly

ocamlbuild Main.native -use-ocamlfind -use-menhir -pkgs 'apron,gmp,oUnit,zarith' -I utils -I domains -I frontend -I main -libs boxMPQ,octD,polkaMPQ,str,zarith
```

# Usage

The analyzer performs a forward reachability analysis of programs with #ifdef-s.

The following general command-line options are recognized
(showing their default value):

	 -tree								set to perform decision tree-based lifted analysis
	 -main main                         set the analyzer entry point (defaults to main)
	 -domain boxes|octagons|polyhedra   set the abstract domain (defaults to boxes)
	 -joinfwd 2                         set the widening delay in forward analysis


# Examples from the paper are in mytests folder:

1. LOOP example

enter the folder that contains the tool, and write

$ ./Main.native -tree -domain polyhedra mytests/loop.c
